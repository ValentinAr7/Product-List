The application consists of 4 main sections - header, sidebar, middle part and footer

### Header

Positioned at the top of the application it includes a header section and subheader/navigation. It is sticky and is always on display.

- Header - splitted into 3 parts - logo, search bar and icons.
  Search Bar: Located in the middle of the header, the search bar provides functionality which allows the users to find the products they're looking for. As users type something, the application checks for matches within the json product file. It then displays these matching products, complete with their images, names, and an 'Add to Cart' button, enabling users to add the product to the cart. When the button is cilcked a notification pops up at the right top corner. This interactive feature enhances the user experience by providing quick, efficient access to the desired products.

- Subheader/Navigation - It includes 5 buttons to navigate through the application.

### Sidebar

The Sidebar in the application allows the user to filter products by price and color.

With color filtering, users can choose a specific color to view products in that particular shade. This is incredibly useful for users who have a clear color preference for the item they're seeking.

The price filter, on the other hand, allows users to define a price range that suits their budget. The application then presents products that fall within this selected price range, assisting users in making financially sound choices.
